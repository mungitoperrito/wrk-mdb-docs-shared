- Adds the ``SearchIndexType`` class, which you can pass
  when constructing a ``SearchIndexModel`` instance. This change
  allows you to specify the index type when creating an Atlas
  Search or Vector Search index. To learn more, see |avs-index-link|.

- Delegates the implementation of the algorithms needed to implement
  the ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` and ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` authentication mechanisms to
  the configured JCA provider. This change means that your application
  can use a configured FIPS-compliant JCA provider and provide a higher
  level of security in your application.
