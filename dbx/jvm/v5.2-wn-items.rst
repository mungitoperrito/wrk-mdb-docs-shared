- Adds the ``SearchIndexType`` class, which you can pass
  when constructing a ``SearchIndexModel`` instance. This change
  allows you to specify the index type when creating an Atlas
  Search or Vector Search index. To learn more, see |avs-index-link|.

- Fixes an issue that caused the ``InsertOneResult.getInsertedId()`` and
  ``InsertManyResult.getInsertedIds()`` to return incorrect document IDs in
  some situations. This change is backported to {+driver-short+} v5.1.4
  and v4.11.4.
